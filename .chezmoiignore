# Ghostty is available on both macOS and Linux, no ignore needed

# iOS tools config only relevant on macOS but doesn't hurt on Linux
# We keep it everywhere — sourcekit-lsp works for SPM projects on Linux

{{ if ne .chezmoi.os "darwin" }}
# Nothing to ignore for Linux currently
# All configs are harmless on both platforms
